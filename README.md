### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Both projects were the same, project one was pseudo code, and project two was the real thing.
The problem being solved here is the process of caching data from an external source, and reading
that data affectively.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by first determining which data structure would be best for the situation. I ended
up choosing an unordered map, and a vector. I went with the unordered map for 0(1) insertions and lookups. I
chose a vector so that I could sort the vector upon the loading process. This allowed the printing to always be
0(n) rather than 0(n)^2.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I googled everything I didn't know how to do, which was a lot considering everything is slightly different in C++. I also
debugged my code properly when certain issues occurred.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I wouldn't really say writing this project changed my approach to writing software. It mostly just semented what I already
do consistently. It was very similar to reading from SQL on the start of a program, and caching that data accordingly. The only
difference being that caches are not always great, and caching everything is kind of insane with too much data.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My C++ knowledge has definitely gotten a little better with these assignments. I also learned to keep things simple when turning
things into a professor, as most college assignments aren't full fledged applications and over-engineering things doesn't help anyone.
